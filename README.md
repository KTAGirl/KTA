# Kick Their Ass (KTA) 
## Very NSFW Wabbajack modlist for Skyrim AE

### The Big Idea
The point of this modlist is to provide hardcore NSFW play, with some idea behind. It is certainly not your usual "play to get abused" kind of setups. Instead, sure, there is a lot of sex around, and your heroine may have tons of sex if you let her, but on the other hand, you and her may at least try to avoid unwanted attention, and you do have a noble task to be done. Women of the whole Skyrim (now referred to as Slaverim or Slutrim) have been enslaved, and you're coming from the future (stark naked, of course, just as T-X came to the Earth back in 2004) to free them. To achieve this task, you may choose to lead a band of like-minded women, or to take a path of the werewolf, or to tame beasts using some special powers of yours, or to resort to life of sneakery and thievery. In any case, the freedom for women of the whole country is at stake (and you can also try kicking sore asses of those pesky males too in the process :grin: ) - so what in the fuck are you waiting for? 

### Technical: Simple+Open=Maintainable+Lean
From the technical perspective, this modlist is intended to be very <ins>**simple**</ins>, very lean, and also easy to modify and maintain. No more convoluted patches and fragile combinations breaking on each mod update. "Keep It Simple, ~~Stupid~~ Student!" is our modus operandi! We try to avoid conflicts, and convoluted patches which happen to be so fragile. Less conflicts to start with = less maintenance. 

And we want KTA to be <ins>**open**</ins>. We hope to get a really wide community around the modlist, and being easy to maintain - it should be possible for ANY community member to issue a fix if modlist owner is not around for any reason. NO MORE WAITING FOR AGES LOOKING AT THAT 'UNDER MAINTENANCE' PIC on Wabbajack! BTW, modlist also includes development tools. 

### About Wabbajack
[Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/) is an ingenious piece of software, which allows you to take the whole modlist - and install it to your PC quite easily, while not violating any rights of mod writers.
