nexusDescription="This tree mod splits the vanilla trees into many variations which I have equipped with many trees, all of which I have created myself.\n<br />There is still a lot to do on this mod for me, but I am already sharing it. \n<br />\n<br />This mod splits the vanilla IDs into groups, allowing different models to be applied to the existing positions. Without additional placements, this creates the impression of more trees. I made a lot of additional changes by hand after the split according to my ideas.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />I have created two versions\n<br />\n<br />The additional noVanillaTrees version does not contain any tree entries of the standard models. So this version can be mixed with other tree mods or tree replacers if it is loaded in the loading order afterwards.\n<br />\n<br />Important ... do not use the reach tree fixes for blubbo trees. I have made these corrections in the mod itself and it is important that the swamps retain my changes.\n<br />\n<br />You no longer need my Blubbo Replacers with the standard version.However, there is no Gildergreen and no Sleeping tree included so you can add a separate mod to your liking.It is possible to combine my Replacer mods with the noVanillaTrees version. This way you can still create a different look.\n<br />\n<br />At the moment I have only created normal lods and billboards to generate own lods with Dyndolod are included. \n<br />I have already started to create low poly meshes for 3D lods, but it will take some time until I am finished with all models.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />I hope you enjoy this wip tree mod\n<br />\n<br />greetings your Blubbo\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />- I have also added patches to make the giant fantasy tree smaller for better compatibility with fabled forest and also a patch that changes the fantasy models in the pine forests to traditional pine trees.\n<br />- additional optional package with downscaled 2k textures added"
