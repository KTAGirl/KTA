nexusDescription="If you generate Dyndolod, deactivate this mod before. I have worked in two worldspaces and the trees are enabled with FullLOD. After that you can activate it again.\n<br />\n<br />Unfortunately, since I don't have as much time as before, I won't be able to create more compatibility patches for other solitude mods. \n<br />\n<br />Anyone who wants to make compatibility patches for my solitude mod is of course welcome to do so.\n<br />If these are patches for large Solitude expansions, then you are also allowed to move, remove, or place more trees that are included in this mod to get a nice overall look.\n<br />It's ok if these patches are edited variants of my esp.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Greetings BlubboDE\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />A patch for Legacy of the Dragonborn  is available from Magnus80. Many thanks for it. \n<br />https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/87785\n<br />\n<br />A Season of Skyrim patch for all my City mods is now available. Many thanks to Shizof. \n<br />https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/104042"
