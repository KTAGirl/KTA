I re-made all fogs and other visual effects and have literally zero impact on my system.\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/9RU4wMB.gif[/img]• Focused on vanilla look and feel, with more intensity, and variation.  Great for lore-friendly, immersive gameplay.\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/9RU4wMB.gif[/img]• Retains all of Bethesda's newly re-designed colors, volumetric lighting / god rays, etc.\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/9RU4wMB.gif[/img]• 25+ all-new carefully crafted high quality sound effects for thunder, rain, wind, and interior sounds.\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/9RU4wMB.gif[/img]• Heavy and light variants of each storm type - heavy rain storms and heavy blizzards are contrasted by light, pleasant variants.\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/9RU4wMB.gif[/img]• Interior sound playback - listen to rain on the rooftops as you cozy up in your Hearthfire home.\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/9RU4wMB.gif[/img]• Brand-new rain and snow textures / heavy particle shaders.\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/9RU4wMB.gif[/img]• Heavy mist / rolling fog weathers and wind effects with no performance loss!\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/9RU4wMB.gif[/img]• Lightly adjusted regions to include more diverse weather - experience rainfall on the coast, light snow in Whiterun.\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/9RU4wMB.gif[/img]• Several brand-new weathers for Solstheim!  Heavy dust storms, burning ash fall, rain, and harbor fogs.\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/9RU4wMB.gif[/img]• Volume sliders in game audio settings to idependently control volume for thunder, rain, and interior sounds.\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/9RU4wMB.gif[/img]• Solves an issue in vanilla where a single thunder sound is chosen during a storm and played repeatedly - now it’s properly random!\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/9RU4wMB.gif[/img]• Sneak buffs during heavy storms for you and companions is in progress and coming in an update!\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/iLcU2NC.gif[/img]\n<br />[center]\n<br />[size=4][b][color=#d7e7ff]VIDEO SHOWCASES\n<br />[/color][/b][/size]#1 overview video by me, #2 incredible cinematic video by Hodilton\n<br />[youtube]SHzWdn5lB0k[/youtube][youtube]HQaaWs7fxwY[/youtube][/center]\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/iLcU2NC.gif[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b][color=#d7e7ff]MORE VIDEOS (Skyrim Classic)[/color][/b][/size]\n<br />Older video reviews for the original SKYRIM CLASSIC version.  These are not up to date but still give you some additional insight!\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lEF1Y6Gs1w][img]http://i.imgur.com/PBiVKhE.jpg[/img][/url] [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSFH0kT9fI8][img]http://i.imgur.com/TinOnaM.jpg[/img][/url]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/iLcU2NC.gif[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[size=4][b][color=#d7e7ff]INSTALLATION &amp; LOAD ORDER[/color][/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/9RU4wMB.gif[/img]• Install and go!  Use NMM or manual (drag-and-drop files from into /data/ folder, and add TrueStormsSE.esp in plugins.txt)\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/9RU4wMB.gif[/img]• Everything is packed into BSA files for cleanliness and ease of installation.\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/9RU4wMB.gif[/img]• Load order shouldn't really matter.  Weather mods will overwrite each other without specific patches, so you should only use one at a time.  There isn't much that will conflict at the moment, but I would put it after Wet and Cold if you're using that.  More as this develops!\n<br />\n<br />[img]https://i.imgur.com/iLcU2NC.gif[/img]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#d7e7ff][size=4]COMPATIBILITY[/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3]There are a multitude of patches available for nearly all of the popular weather mods, thanks to the wonderful community.  A search for \"True Storms\" here on Nexus will yield many results.[/size][/b][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />• Darker Nights (100% compatible!  Patch part of Darker Nights v1.4!)\n<br />• Frostfall (100% compatible)\n<br />• Wet and Cold (90% compatible) -- we both add Solstheim weathers, so whatever loads last will 'win' til a patch is made but will work fine otherwise\n<br />• ELFX (90% compatible) -- ELFX mostly edits interiors, but if you're using ELFX Exteriors or Weathers, just load True Storms after in your load order\n<br />• Realistic Lighting Overhaul (90%) -- Interiors are fully compatible, but not the RLO weathers.  If you load True Storms after RLO you will get RLO's interiors, and my storms.[b]\n<br />[/b]"
