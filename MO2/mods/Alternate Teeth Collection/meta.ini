nexusDescription="[b][color=#ffff00][font=Georgia][size=4]What is it?[/size][/font][/color][/b]\n<br />\n<br />[font=Georgia][size=3]These are [u][i][b]human[/b][/i][/u] teeth I made using mouth assets from Fair Skin (thank you[b] [/b][/size][size=3][b][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/4557236]HHaleyy[/url])[/b][color=#f1f1f1] . I mean there are literally hundreds if not thousands of hair, eye, brow and makeup options and like 10 or so teeth options. Sure you don't see them as often but if your going to bother running 4-8k skin textures, you gotta have some decent teeth to fully dial in your character.\n<br />\n<br />The textures are modified to provide a number of different options, including brightness levels and varying upper incisors. All mesh versions have been modified to prevent the ends of the teeth from being cut off and elongate and skew them for a more natural and slightly imperfect look. Of course to each their own, so if they look like garbage to you, they are textures and meshes only so install and uninstall at your leisure. \n<br />\n<br />[/color][/size][/font][i][u][b][size=3]These can be used with vanilla, Expressive Facegen Morphs and COTR (see installation and requirements sections).[/size][/b][/u][/i][font=Georgia]\n<br />\n<br />[size=3]I tried them with multiple presets and with ENB and without, though of course ENB is always recommended. I am a dabbler at best so YMMV, though I certainly hope they work for you and would be happy to \"try\" to resolve any issues if you would be so kind as to let me know. The files include male teeth but I have not tested them outside of talking to some male NPCs. [/size][size=3]If the alignment is off, the mouth section of Racemenu has tooth sliders you can use to adjust their size and position. You can also fine tune them in the sculpting section to change teen size and angles.[/size][/font]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[color=#ffff00][size=4][font=Georgia][b]Currently 24 variants![/b][/font]\n<br />[/size][/color]\n<br />[size=3][b]\n<br />[font=Tahoma][i](3) Different Meshes: [/i][/font][/b]\n<br />\n<br />   [font=Georgia]﻿Vanilla - Vanilla mesh which features low poly raised K9s for a more 3 dimensional look (looks great with Vampire fangs)\n<br />\n<br />       Standard aka vanilla friendly - Vanilla mesh with smoothed K9s for a less blocky look\n<br />\n<br />   ﻿Expressive Facegen Morphs - Patch for max compatibility with Expressive Facegen Morphs mod (linked below and recommended)[/font]\n<br /> [/size]\n<br />\n<br />[b][font=Tahoma][i](8) Different Textures: [/i][/font][/b]\n<br />\n<br />   [font=Georgia][size=3]﻿Standard - Muted brightness. Reduce divet between upper central incisors. Shortened lower incisors.\n<br />\n<br />   ﻿Standard 2 - Muted brightness.

Choose YES to any overwrites. Teeth must be installed after Expressive Facegen Morphs if you use it, or any skin texture packs that include teeth like the exceptional Fair Skin or Diamond skin and of course any previous teeth mods you may have installed. No ESP, so no load sorting post install.\n<br />\n<br />Special note for COTR users - If you have not already, you will need the mod Refined Teeth for Charmer of the Reach linked in the requirements section. It will change the COTR file path to the vanilla path that my mod is using. Note, it does not play well with COTR dependent followers per the comment and bug section of the mod.\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/color][/font]\n<br />[b][color=#ffff00][size=4]Requirements:[/size][/color]\n<br />\n<br />[/b][font=Georgia][size=3][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35785]Expressive Facegen Morphs SE[/url] and all it's requirements (only if using the Expressive version of my teeth) (thanks to Niroku)\n<br />\n<br />[/size][/font][font=Georgia][size=3][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35468?tab=description]Refined Teeth for Charmers of the Reach (COTR)[/url] and all of it's requirements (only if using COTR) (thanks Aixcalibur)[/size][/font]\n<br />\n<br />[b][size=3]\n<br />[color=#ffff00]Nice to haves:[/color][/size][/b][color=#ffff00]\n<br />[/color]\n<br />[size=3][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19080]RaceMenu[/url] (thanks to expired6978)\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://vectorplexus.com/files/file/283-high-poly-head/]High Poly Head[/url] (if not using COTR) (Offsite, thanks to KouLeifoh)[/size]"
