nexusDescription="[color=#c27ba0][size=5]Overview[/size][/color]\n<br />As of the Anniversary update to Skyrim, Survival Mode is no longer an optional DLC and now ships as a core part of the game. This adds a prompt when you start a new game asking you if you want to enable Survival Mode or not. This may work fine for the vanilla game, but not so much for curated mod setups where we already know what we want and may prefer other survival mods entirely.\n<br />\n<br />This mod edits Survival's main script to get rid of the prompt. It doesn't require a plugin and can even be safely included in other mods without adding Survival Mode itself as a master.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#c27ba0][size=5]Installation[/size][/color]\n<br />Choose one of these files depending on what works best for your setup:\n<br />\n<br />[b]Disable By Default[/b] - Survival Mode will be disabled until it is manually enabled in the Gameplay Settings menu. Install this if you just want the automatic prompt gone.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Disable Permanently[/b] - Survival Mode will always be disabled, and the toggle will never be added to the Gameplay Settings menu. Install this if you are using a different mod to provide survival mechanics. If you are an author of a survival mod, it is also highly suggested to include this script in your mod.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Enable By Default[/b] - Survival Mode will be automatically enabled when it becomes available (the first time you go outside), with a notification. Install this if your modlist is based around Survival Mode being used."
