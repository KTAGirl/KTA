So, here I am, posting my Marks of Beauty mod.\n<br /> \n<br />[b]What’s included in this mod:[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]15 freckle overlays\n<br />[*]15 mole overlays\n<br />[*]10 age spot overlays\n<br />[*]10 birthmark overlays\n<br />[*]7 miscellaneous overlays including:  4 under eye overlays and 3 for uneven redness \n<br />[/list] \n<br />This mod requires RaceMenu.  They will be listed under the Makeup Tab. Overlays are called “Lamenthia.”  While I created these to be used for female characters, some may look good on men as well.\n<br /> \n<br />I may add more later, and I’m open for requests.  If you do have requests, please be specific instead of asking for ‘more freckles.’  \n<br />Reference photos are even better.\n<br /> \n<br />[i]“Lamenthia made some gorgeous overlays that really adds to your character, adding realism to their skin texture.  These aren’t just freckles and moles.  The age spots, combined with the under eye overlays makes your character look older without the excessive eldery look.  Even better, you don’t need an extra overlay for the neck.  The freckles and moles travel down the throat for added realism.  I now use her mod solely for my female NPCs and characters.”[/i]  ~ PoeticAnt44\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[center][youtube]pp60y6iuLLY[/youtube]﻿[/center][/size][left][/left][size=3]\n<br />\n<br />[/size][left][size=3]Thank you, PoeticAnt44, for testing, screenshots, helping, suggesting the name for this mod, giving me confidence and encouraging me to release this mod. Without you this mod would still be only in my personal use.[/size][/left]"
