nexusDescription="[center][img]http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/images/2598850-1366210488.png[/img][/center]\r\n\r\n[size=15][color=red] Warning: this mod contains excessive violence and gore.[/color] [/size]\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Introduction:[/b][/size]\r\nThis mod’s main goal is to give a new more spectacular look to Skyrim’s combat, without intervention into basic game-play balance. No tricks like damage, skills, perks or AI modification. Only visual ice-cream on the cake. \r\nMore intensity, realism and new feeling while fighting. Make NPCs die in various ways depending on the cause of the death. Feel the power in your  weapon: dismember, decapitate, eviscerate. Spill blood of your enemies, make them scream out of pain, spread their intestines and brains all over the place. Burn them to charred corps, freeze into ice block and smash in pieces. Cause terrible wounds, convulsions, head explosion or carbonization with lightning. \r\nAll this is present in this mod. Enjoy.\r\n[center][youtube]SmQfPzoxRrA[/youtube][/center]\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]How it works :[/b][/size]\r\nThe chance of the mutilation is configurable through MCM menu, yet there are certain limitations and conditions to fill. All depend from weapon you carry and movement you execute.\r\n\r\n[i][u]Moving power attack:[/i][/u]\r\n-\tSword, axe, dagger, mace, war hammer\t\t–>\tcut off arm\r\n-\tGreat sword, great axe\t\t–>\tcut in half horizontally\r\n-\tWerewolf\t\t–>\teverything is possible\r\n\t\r\n[i][u]Stand power attack:[/i][/u]\r\n-\tSword, axe, dagger, great sword, great axe\t –>\teviscerate vertically\r\n-\tmace, war hammer\t–>\teviscerate vertically or/and crush head\r\n-\tWerewolf\t\t–>\teverything is possible\r\n\r\n[i][u]Normal attack:[/i][/u]\r\n-\tAny melee weapon\t\t–>\tcut off arm\r\n\r\n* Moving and standing attack detection system is not yet 100% certain. You may trigger moving power attack effect when execute standing power attack and inverse. However it works correctly in most cases. It takes a little second for script to realize that actor is not moving.\r\n* Enchanted weapons will diminish a bit your chances to trigger mutilation. Because enchantment can kill the actor before physical damage and prevent script executing.\r\n* Any actor equipped with matching weapon can cause gory death. But player must be near.\r\n* Magic is not affected by random chance and works all the time if possible.\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Other useful information and functionality:[/b][/size]\r\n-\tWorks for all NPCs of all humanoid races except old people, children, essential and protected.\r\n-\tPlayer is immunised to all kind of effects(for being too buggy)\r\n-\tCut in half, evisceration and dismemberment may occur only on NPCs wearing one of the                          \r\n        supported armors such as:[u]Fur, Elven, Forsworn, Hide, Studded, Imperial, Iron, Stormcloaks\r\n        and guards armors, Necromancer and Warlock robes.[/u]\r\n-\tSome of the effects can stack and replace one each other.\r\n-\tBodies cut in half or smashed in pieces can not be reanimated.\r\n-\tHead crush works on any character\r\n-\tTo work properly Thalmor robe was split. Hood and robe can be worn separately.\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Requirements: [/b][/size]\r\n[size=3][color=yellow][u]SKSE[/u][/color][/size]\r\n[size=3][color=yellow][u]SkyUi 3.4 [/u][/color][/size]\r\n\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Installation[/b][/size]\r\n1.Remove older version if you have any.\r\n2.Go to isolated(preferably interior) place with no NPC around dead or alive. Also fire your follower or leave him/her outside.\r\n3.Save game\r\n4.Install main core of the mod first. Copy files in your Skyrim “Data” folder or use Mod Manager. \r\n5.Install one of the meshes pack at you choice. CBBE or Vanilla. Symply copy to Data folder.\r\n6.(Optional) Install alternative skeletons from skeletons packs, for compatibility with other mods you use.\r\n7.Do \\\"reset players effects\\\" through MCM configuration menu first time you run Skyrim and save game.\r\n6.That\\'s it, enjoy\r\n\r\n[color=Red][size=3][b]*Important*[/b][/size][/color]\r\n Mod will be automatically applied on all new coming characters, but it will effect already existing NPCs later. After NPC was reset and reloaded. Simply travel far enough , it should be good at your return. Still not working? Try to do reset player’s effects throught configuration menu. Make sure you have all files copied where they should. Try to reinstall it manually. Still nothing? Track down the incompatibilities.\r\n\r\n[size=3][b]Performances[/b][/size]\r\nThis mod will NOT cause a serious FPS drop but high performance configuration is recommended. \r\n\r\n[color=Green][size=3][b]Recommended mods:[/b][/size][/color]\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=601]Realistic Ragdolls and Force[/url] (don\\'t forget compatible skeleton provided here)\r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17214 ]No Spinning Death Animation[/url] \r\n[url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/60/? ]Enhanced Blood Textures[/url] or [url=http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/12798/? ]Crimson Tide[/url] \r\nWhant more blood?
