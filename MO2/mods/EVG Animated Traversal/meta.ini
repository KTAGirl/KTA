Easier said than done, but not the worst thing to make.\n<br />\n<br />Example:\n<br />idletelvannitower_floatup.hkx (4.6 seconds) (location z +1000)\n<br />EVG_vault.hkx (2.3 seconds) (location y +120)\n<br />\n<br />Now- we can't use the Telvanni furniture specifically, as the movement is baked into the behaviours, not the animation file.\n<br />Instead, we use Dynamic Animation Replacer to hijack another existing 'single use' animation in the vanilla game, that has no movement.\n<br />Then we use Animation Motion Revolution to add movement data to that new animation.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#a4c2f4][i]Why not a real climbing system?[/i][/color]\n<br />can't code. i took an html5 class once. anyway. someone talented is working on one. keep ur eyes peeled\n<br />\n<br />[color=#a4c2f4][i]You have a ladder animation.

[/i][/color]\n<br />No! you can literally use it however you want. the Modder's Documentation article is help for replicating how /i/ intended it,\n<br />which matches the way the telvanni float is used in the base game.\n<br />If you're a papyrus/SKSE genius, do. what. you. want.\n<br />copy paste the animations into another folder to replace others, make them trigger based on other actions, etc.\n<br />just require the main file so people still download this o_o\n<br />(it's needed anyway for the sounds to function.)\n<br />\n<br />[color=#a4c2f4][i]Do you have a patreon? Any early access mods?[/i][/color]\n<br />I feel like I don't mod enough to do anything like a patreon. I have many hobbies, and my work ethic gets me burnt out every other month- \n<br />it's a vicious cycle LMAO\n<br />\n<br />There IS a donate button at the top of the nexus page, but please do not expect any updates or new mods in return. I'm just out here living [b]?[/b]\n<br />\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />Compatibility:\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[color=#a2c4c9][b]Innately Compatible[/b]\n<br />[/color]Other Nemesis Behaviour mods:\n<br />(SkySA, Paraglider, True Directional Movement, Combat Gameplay Overhaul etc.)\n<br />\n<br />Other Animation mods\n<br />\n<br />like.. everything tbh, this mod doesn't touch any existing systems!\n<br />\n<br />New meshes added use vanilla UVs, so they (should) work with your textures.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#b6d7a8]Adjusted/taken into consideration to be compatible[/color][/b]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47670]Immersive Interactions - Animated Actions[/url]﻿\n<br /> - This allows you to physically interact with ground levers, unlike in vanilla.\n<br />[i]As there have been a few comments asking, Immersive Interactions is compatible and tested on multiple modlists as I use it myself.[/i]\n<br />\n<br />Sound Effect mods - [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/523]Immersive Sounds - Compendium[/url]﻿, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/21706239?tab=user+files]Satafinix Collection[/url]\n<br />Animated Traversal ignores these sounds, and uses a duplicate of vanilla sounds instead. This was done because many 'generic collision' sounds like bodies on surfaces, etc that I tried to repurpose for EVGAT didn't really match what I was going for in the animation compared to vanilla.[size=1]\n<br />(Some lighter vanilla body 'thumps' were much bassier and weighty in ISC for example- which is good, and works very well in game for the original intended purpose! I use it myself. The softer vanilla sounds just make more sense for climbing/drops)\n<br />[/size]\n<br />[b][color=#ffe599]It'll look weird, but it's fine[/color][/b]\n<br />Destructible object mods - [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28291]Destructible Skyrim - Breakable Objects (Beta)[/url]﻿\n<br />Unless this is taken into consideration by level designers, things that you climb on could be destroyed. It won't break animation triggers because they don't depend on these objects at all, but it'll just look weird.\n<br />\n<br />Procedural Leaning - [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33767]CGO[/url]﻿/[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51614] True Directional Movement[/url]﻿\n<br />Looks funny. I would turn it down to the lowest setting possible, imo, just a touch of it is good for me :  )\n<br />\n<br />Mesh replacers\n<br />An obvious one, if someone designs a climbing setup around specific objects and then those objects are changed to a drastically different shape, yeah it'll look a little weird.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#f9cb9c][b]May cause issues[/b][/color]\n<br />Cell/Location/Interior/Exterior compatibility will be up to the add-on author using this mod.\n<br />No other mod I'm aware of touches the lever pulling systems, which is the only thing EVGAT edits directly. Nearly everything in this mod is isolated.\n<br />\n<br />Mods that drastically change the height of humanoids - High heels, 'Lore-edits' to vanilla races\n<br />Character scale directly affects the animation, as well as multiplies the distance traveled per animation.\n<br />(the forced character scaling present in the vanilla game does not work on single animation objects, like Telvanni float. booo)\n<br />\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5271]Rigmor of Bruma[/url]﻿ - cell edit in the same spot as the Content Package ;-;\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#dd7e6b]Not compatible[/color][/b]\n<br />None noted.\n<br />[b]\n<br />[b]Add-On Mods, Implementation[/b][/b]\n<br />For widespread EVGAT use, existing furniture objects need to be swapped out for animation-enabled ones.\n<br />Please be careful with automated tool use. (Synthesis, Base Object Swapper) As many objects in the base game/mods are just used for decorative purposes, I cannot predict what happens if you interact with an oddly aligned static object.\n<br />\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />Troubleshooting:\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ea9999]Q: Your mod isn't working![/color][/b]\n<br />A: this tells me nothing\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ea9999]Q: Your mod doesn't add any markers![/color][/b]\n<br />A: yes, as stated at the top of the description in bold letters, this is a framework :(\n<br /> \n<br />[b][color=#ea9999]Q: How can I even tell if the mod is working?[/color][/b]\n<br />In the console:\n<br />[font=Courier New]'﻿coc evgmotioncourse'[/font]\n<br />Teleports you to the testing cell where there are markers.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ea9999]Q: I get a lever animation.[/color][/b]\n<br />A: Make sure you have the latest version of [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92109]Open Animation Replacer[/url]﻿ installed.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#ea9999]Q: How can I tell if Open Animation Replacer is working?[/color][/b]\n<br />A: Shift + O is the default hotkey to open the OAR UI.

Approach from a distance, or just don't use add-on mods that use hand-placed markers.\n<br />\n<br />[b]Q: it looks very wobbly/janky[/b]\n<br />A: using [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51614]True Directional Movement[/url] or [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33767]Combat Gameplay Overhaul[/url]?\n<br />procedural leaning in these mods do that. you can reduce this in their MCMs. \n<br />[line]\n<br />\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />Known Issues:\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />\n<br />Q: I can select the 'wrong' marker, eg. on the opposite side of where I am\n<br />A: Engine limitation, kind of. Approach from a distance, or just don't use add-on mods that use hand-placed markers.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Sounds do not match the surface that my character is on.\n<br />A: Furniture animations remove collision from the player, and mess with detecting sounds.\n<br />Therefore, I added very generic, all-purpose sounds baked into the animation's annotations.\n<br />If you want accurate sounds, you'll need to make copies of the animation with different sound annotations and then do CK work to place them where they should be ingame.\n<br />\n<br />Q: My character does not align well with the animation. My hands float above/under things.\n<br />A: the scaling mechanic in the game doesn't work on this, I did what I could sorry (also why are you using a height lower than .95 and bigger than 1.1?)[/left]\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />[/spoiler]\n<br />[img]https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/44449/44449-1644369484-796390068.png[/img]\n<br />[color=#fce5cd][size=5][b]Animations &amp; Systems[/b][/size][/color]\n<br />[spoiler]\n<br />[size=4]Single Movement Animations[/size]\n<br />\n<br />⇆ grounded ⇆\n<br />\n<br />Vault: Basic vault over a waist-height obstacle.
