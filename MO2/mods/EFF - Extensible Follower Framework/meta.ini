It will conflict with the follower tweak that makes 10 followers possible that is floating around, it does a similar thing but I wrote my own methods that can scale by an array so making 100 possible wasn't far off.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b]Making it work[/b][/size]\n<br />Dismiss any companion you may have before or after installing this mod to ensure they get out of the old follower alias and into the new.\n<br />\n<br />You do not need to edit any NPC's or do anything extra for this to work, you just install the plugin and you should be able to talk to any follower and recruit them as normal with the exception you wont be told you already have a follower unless you reach the 100 follower limit. (I highly doubt this happening, Papyrus is more likely implode on itself before then)\n<br />\n<br />[size=6][b][color=#FFFF00]C[/color][color=#FFFF13]o[/color][color=#FFFF27]m[/color][color=#FFFF3A]p[/color][color=#FFFF4E]a[/color][color=#FFFF62]t[/color][color=#FFFF75]i[/color][color=#FFFF89]b[/color][color=#FFFF9C]i[/color][color=#FFFFB0]l[/color][color=#FFFFC4]i[/color][color=#FFFFD7]t[/color][color=#FFFFEB]y[/color][/b][/size]\n<br />Should be compatible with horse follower mods and Better Followers as well assuming [b]XFLDialogue[/b] and [b]XFLPlugin[/b] are loaded after said mod.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=6][b][color=#FFFF00]U[/color][color=#FFFF12]n[/color][color=#FFFF24]i[/color][color=#FFFF36]n[/color][color=#FFFF48]s[/color][color=#FFFF5B]t[/color][color=#FFFF6D]a[/color][color=#FFFF7F]l[/color][color=#FFFF91]l[/color][color=#FFFFA3]a[/color][color=#FFFFB6]t[/color][color=#FFFFC8]i[/color][color=#FFFFDA]o[/color][color=#FFFFEC]n[/color][/b][/size]\n<br />Before removing this mod make sure you dismiss all of your companions through this system. After dismissing all of your companions you need to make sure none of this mods scripts are still running, to do that you have to stop the quests controlling the scripts.\n<br />stopquest DialogueFollowerExtended (FollowerExtension for versions &gt;= 3.0)\n<br />stopquest FollowerMenu\n<br />Wait some ingame time for the scripts to run through\n<br />Save your game\n<br />Uninstall\n<br />Load your save\n<br />Save your game\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b]Creating custom companions[/b][/size]\n<br />You still create your custom companions in the same manner, add them to the PotentialFollower faction or PotentialHireling faction and increase your relationship rank. Followers tie in with favor, and favor is actually your relationship rank.\n<br />\n<br />If your companion uses a custom recruit or dismiss dialogue that means you have to edit the dialogue script, and your companion will not work with this mod because the vanilla functions to recruit are no longer used, I may in the future move the quest portion of this mod to an ESM so users can link to those functions instead.\n<br />\n<br />[size=5][b]Reducing the limit[/b][/size]\n<br />Not sure why you would want to reduce the limit, maybe to put a restraint on yourself I guess. The limit is controlled by a global variable now rather than a static one or zero.\n<br />Example:\n<br />Set PlayerFollowerMaximum to 5\n<br />\n<br />[size=6][b][color=#FFFF00]T[/color][color=#FFFF11]r[/color][color=#FFFF22]o[/color][color=#FFFF33]u[/color][color=#FFFF44]b[/color][color=#FFFF55]l[/color][color=#FFFF66]e[/color][color=#FFFF77]s[/color][color=#FFFF88]h[/color][color=#FFFF99]o[/color][color=#FFFFAA]o[/color][color=#FFFFBB]t[/color][color=#FFFFCC]i[/color][color=#FFFFDD]n[/color][color=#FFFFEE]g[/color][/b][/size]\n<br />[color=red](1) If you are having an issue where you tell another follower to follow you but they just stand there and do nothing.[/color]\n<br />CHECK YOUR GAME VERSION, IT MUST BE 1.3 OR HIGHER. Or check to make sure you do not have another conflicting mod that edits the follower system.\n<br />\n<br />[color=red](2) If you are experiencing a problem with a particular follower, for example:\n<br />You have all the dialogue options as if they are following you, but aren't really following you, things like \"Wait Here, Follow Me, It's time for us to part ways\" this means that they are stuck in the follower system.[/color]\n<br />They can be recovered from this by opening the Console, clicking on them, and typing the following:\n<br />removefromfaction 5C84E \n<br />removefromfaction 5c84c \n<br />removefromfaction bd738 \n<br />or\n<br />addtofaction 5C84E -1\n<br />addtofaction 5c84c -1\n<br />addtofaction bd738 -1\n<br />\n<br />[color=red](3) Why does Cicero or the DBInitiates not work right?[/color]\n<br />Cicero goes into the vanilla system because I wanted to avoid editing the particular quests that deal with it, it ties in with the main companions script and some other critical scripts. It's safer to just leave a few followers in the vanilla system then to edit those scripts and risk breaking compatibility with other mods. \n<br />\n<br />Cicero and the Initiates don't technically use the vanilla system at all, they have their own method of \"Follow\" \"Wait\" and \"Dismiss\" they only set or unset the vanilla variable to determine if you already have a follower. Also meaning they won't respond to those corresponding menu commands. Cicero uses an alias to acquire his follower-like packages, the initiates actually have their packages directly on the NPC. What I could do is re-route their commands to my system, but I would have to significantly raise the quest priority of FollowerExtension so that my packages will override his. The only way to completely rid them of their bad system would be to \"duplicate\" the effects of my system on their aliases, or completely rid them of their system and just plain add them to mine, which would mean editing the actual DBInitiate NPC. \n<br />\n<br />If I wanted to rid them of their system I would have to \n<br />Edit the Darkbrotherhood quest Alias to not use the DBCicero packages \n<br />Edit the \"QF_DBEviction_0006F9A5\" script to not use their variables and use my system to dismiss \n<br />Edit the \"companionshousekeeping\" (Critical) script to dismiss them appropriately and not use their variables \n<br />Edit the DBInitiate NPC's to not use their packages anymore \n<br />\n<br />If I wanted to duplicate my features onto their system \n<br />I would basically have to do everything twice, once for my system, and once for the DB followers as they would use different aliases."
