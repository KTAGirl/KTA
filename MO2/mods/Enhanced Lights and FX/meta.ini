You can stick with LOOT load order.\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]The ELFX Enhancer[/u][/b] \n<br />\n<br />-Should be compatible with any mod that doesn't change imagespaces and lighting templates, which means ambient light, fog, contrast, saturation, bloom, depth of field, etc.\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]The ELFX Exteriors[/u][/b] \n<br />\n<br />-It should be compatible with everything that doens't place an object over the light sources I placed. You can stick with LOOT load order.\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]The ELFX Weathers[/u][/b]\n<br />\n<br />-It should be compatible with any mod that doesn't change the weathers. It may be compatible with Climates of Tamriel, because it doesn't change the vanilla weathers, but I don't recommend it, because CoT has so much weathers that you may barely experience mine.\n<br />\n<br />[b][u]Enhanced Ice[/u][/b]\n<br />\n<br />-It should be compatible with any ice retexture and any mod that change the icebergs.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />It should be compatible with any ENB setting, but I won't give any support to features that are changed by the ENB.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[img]http://fabioemerick.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/credits-e1353217394944.png[/img]\n<br />\n<br />Insanely thanks to\n<br />\n<br />-Bethesda for Skyrim and Creation Kit\n<br />-skyfox69 for NifUtils\n<br />-eclips3d for the installer\n<br />-xdayman for BAIN installer\n<br />-Niftools Team for Nifskope\n<br />-Autodesk\n<br />-zaga86 for his ice textures.\n<br />-Nexus community"
