nexusDescription="By the grace of God, Tiwa44 &amp; Vyxenne I bring to thee the one and only MINIDRESSES COLLECTION. Now converted to CBBE body with bodyslide and physics support.\n<br />\n<br />I took Vyxenne's version of Tiwa44's Minidresses mod and ran every single mesh through outfit studio and morphed them to CBBE shape adding sliders and weights as I went. I've included a prebuilt set in the shape of CBBE curvy for your convenience. I also took the liberty of removing the odd unfitting nifs (there were some male boots I think) to clean up things a little bit.\n<br />\n<br />After I CBBE'ized the meshes, I took Vyxenne's mod, renamed the .esp and replaced her mesh folder with mine. I slapped the bodyslide files on top of that, wrapped it up and here we are.\n<br />\n<br />Now the work isn't perfected, I'm well aware of that. I worked on this set for a week, learning, altering, sliding, morphing, rebuilding and what have you. After several days I got to a point where I realized I had horribly molested many of the outfits by my amateur brushing and I decided to scrap my initial work. Then I spent two days using all my spare time to rebuild the set with minimal changes. As a result, the meshes are mostly smooth but minor clipping can be expected. I will work on this and update the mod but for most purposes everything should work fine.\n<br />\n<br />[i][size=3][b]Ok, what is this?[/b][/size][/i]\n<br />Vanilla clothing replacer. This changes the visual design of all vanilla (+DLC) cloth with a new, appealing yet not full bikini mode style. I've included a few pictures so you'll get the idea.\n<br />\n<br />[i][size=3][b]CBBE UNP ABC WTF?[/b][/size][/i]\n<br />They're body types. UNP was superior (YMMV) in Skyrim LE but CBBE has been updated for SSE featuring a new, high poly body and additional sliders. Thus, I changed over after being years of faithful UNP user.\n<br />\n<br />Check out the original UNP Minidresses Collection by Tiwa44 [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/47376]here.[/url]\n<br />Check out the SSE conversion for UNP bodies by Vyxenne [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12198]here.[/url]\n<br />Check out the Skyrim LE CBBE conversion by sgtmcbiscuits [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/85652]here.[/url]\n<br />\n<br />[i][size=3][b]How do I bodyslide?[/b][/size][/i]\n<br />1) Install Bodyslide &amp; Outfit studio\n<br />2) Install my mod\n<br />3) Open bodyslide &amp; select Minidresses CBBE SE from the group filter (up at the top, middle)\n<br />4) Select a body preset &amp; click batch build at the bottom (ctrl click if you want a custom directory location)\n<br />5) Play!\n<br />\n<br />[i][size=3][b]Gigist no I can't. Help :([/b][/size][/i]\n<br />You don't need bodyslide. It's only if you want to change the shape of the clothing. I've included prebuilt shapes for CBBE curvy as stated in the introduction.\n<br />\n<br />[i][size=3][b]Will they jiggle, there must be jiggle?[/b][/size][/i]\n<br />You bet there is. I added weights to pieces where I felt it was fitting which in the case of clothing, is pretty much everywhere.\n<br />Remember that you need CBP physics for immersive bouncing.\n<br />\n<br />[i][size=3][b]Speaking of which, why there's only cloth included?[/b][/size][/i]\n<br />Armors are found in CBBE Spice Gear mod [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16321]here[/url], similar to the originals mods.\n<br />\n<br />[i][size=3][b]Who's the bae in the 1st pic, can I has?[/b][/size][/i]\n<br />That's [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60916]Midori[/url] by Skylaskyrim. It's a self-ported and slightly tweaked version of the second best waifu of all times.\n<br />\n<br />[i][size=3][b]What's the .esp for?[/b][/size][/i]\n<br />From the original page:\n<br />What Tiwa44_minidresses.esp modifies:\n<br />      - miner boots armor addon mesh path: fix for female's miner boots displaying as the male ones.\n<br />      - yarl03 boots armor addon mesh path: fix for female's yarl03 boots displaying as the male ones.\n<br />      - ragged trousers armor addon mesh path: fix for female's ragged trousers displaying as the roughspun tunic.\n<br />What Tiwa44_minidresses_dragonborn.esp modifies:\n<br />      - skaal boots and torso armor addons mesh paths: fix for female weight slider not working.\n<br />\n<br />[i][size=3][b]Something isn't right, fix plx![/b][/size][/i]\n<br />Leave a comment and I'll look into it. I'm not an expert modder but will do my best to polish this gear set. It damn well deserves it.\n<br />\n<br />[i][size=3][b]U broke my fingers![/b][/size][/i]\n<br />Update to the latest version.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u][color=#ff0000][b][size=5]Known issues[/size][/b][/color][/u]\n<br />Possibly minor clipping? Proper body zaps will be added in the future.\n<br />\n<br />[b][color=#00ffff][size=5]Required files[/size][/color][/b]\n<br />For physics:\n<br />[url=http://skse.silverlock.org/]SKSE64[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1988]XP32 Skeleton[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3038]FNIS[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13207]CBP Physics[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/198]CBBE body[/url] (just for hands / feet to avoid seams)\n<br />\n<br />For non-physics:\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/198]CBBE body[/url] (just for hands / feet to avoid seams)\n<br />\n<br />[color=#1e84cc][b][size=5]Installation[/size][/b][/color]\n<br />Download the mod and install with a mod manager of your choice.\n<br />Alternatively extract the contents to Steam/steamapps/common/Skyrim Special Edition/Data\n<br />\n<br />Mod manager method recommended.\n<br />\n<br />Uninstall by removing the mod via your manager or manually from Data folder (see the archive for exact files)\n<br />Verify your game files with Steam to restore vanilla armors to their original state if they're broken.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#00ff00][b][size=5]Compatibility[/size][/b][/color]\n<br />Compatible with everything that doesn't change the vanilla meshes.
