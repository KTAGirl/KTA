nexusDescription="[size=5]Introduce[/size]\n<br />\n<br />Your endurance is low and you are out of breath. Your stomach hurts so much when you were hit by an enemy, and your spine feels numb. But you are not defeated yet!\n<br />\n<br /> These Idle animations appear when your stamina or health is below 33%. If this animation appears, it means you are in critical condition. You will need to catch your breath and heal immediately.\n<br />\n<br />The poses are for women only and only apply to you or your followers.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]Update[/size]\n<br />\n<br />2024-08-16 Update: now offer 54 types of bleed Idles, Add 3 idles when magicka is below 15%, Modified bleedout path for users using fnis or pandora engine. Changed the internal structure of OAR condition.  [size=5][b]Now requires OAR 2.3.0 or higher.[/b][/size]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />2024-04-27 Update: now offer 44 types of Idles, weapon position , which appeared at 50% health of Idle, has been corrected. The priority number has changed. Bleedout idles are now 223500 to 223544 and Exhausted Idles are 7094600 to 7094644. This is to avoid conflict with EVG Conditional Idles Priority numbers.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />2024-03-26 Update: Since someone else requested a pose pack, I providing a pose pack as well. If you don't want to use the pose pack, just use it as before. If you want to use the pose pack, you need to use the Poser hot keys mod. Poses can be used after using a Behavior update engine such as FNIS, NEMESIS, or Pandora.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />2024-02-27 Update: \n<br />\n<br />Now only available in OAR version. This is because management is difficult. \n<br />Added some Bleedout Trans in Animation. Taken from Female Death animation. ([url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93920]mods/93920[/url]) If you like his work, please download and Endorse it please.\n<br />Added Bleedout Idles. now offer 20 Bleedout Random Idles shared with Exhausted Idles.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />2024-02-18 Update : \n<br />\n<br />The forward animation during bleeding animations now moves forward correctly. I am not the creator of the bleeding animation, it was created by Gunslicer. This animation moveset is not intended for the Bleeding animation. Nonetheless, there was a lot of talk about the bleeding animation movement. This problem seems to have arisen because GS's bleeding animation overhaul was placed in folder 3501 of my mod. I modified to hkx poser, simply reverse direction and now expect the character to move forward correctly while bleeding.  If you don't want the Bleeding animation to change, just delete the folders 3501 to 3509 in my mod. \n<br />\n<br />Also added OAR version. I still think that for most users OAR will not be necessary. There have been people continuously requesting an OAR version, but since it already works perfectly in OAR and the condition of my mod does not require additional OAR functions, there was no need to create new one. If there is one, it would be that it looks prettier when viewed on the OAR management UI. I've been playing it myself for two days and it works very well.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />It's impossible to accommodate everyone's needs when uploading these types of mods, so it's a good idea to know how to modify DAR conditions or OAR conditions. Create your own gaming environment with the conditions you want.\n<br />\n<br />Come on guys, I'm not even an English speaker. Most Skyrim mod information is posted in English, and English speakers can easily get the information they want just by looking for it. It is an overwhelmingly better environment compared to non-English speakers. A lot of people just use mods the way the modder sets them, and I don't think that's wrong, but don't just expect others to do it for you when there are so many easy ways to do it yourself if you want. I hope more people will use my mod, but it is impossible to meet all the requests of so many people (especially when there are condition settings that can vary people's tastes). I hope you have fun too, as you get what you want for yourself.\n<br />\n<br />A total of 21 types of Exhausted idle are provided, imported or modified from pose packs here and there, and although not perfect, they also provide run and sprint animations, and Bleed out idle, which has a similar feel.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Please enjoy?\n<br />\n<br />[size=5]My other mods[/size]\n<br />\n<br />You can find my other works from [url=https://arca.live/b/skyrimsemod]here[/url]"
