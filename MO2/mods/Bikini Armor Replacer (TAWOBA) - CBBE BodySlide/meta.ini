The mod contains Bodyslide files but no pre-built meshes, so don't forget to build your armors - see [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/201]BodySlide[/url] page for details. Super simple mesh replacer, no esp required.\n<br />\n<br />[u][color=#ffe599]How do I use it?[/color][/u] - Install the mod using your preferred method. Next, build the armors in Bodyslide using your preferred Bodyslide body shape preset. Each armor has a substantial amount of customization options. The new armor meshes will take the place of in-game armor meshes, providing you the look of the bikini armors without impacting gameplay or stats. Great for use with mods that don't always play well with nonstandard armor sets.\n<br />\n<br />[u][color=#ffe599]Do I need to download the originals?[/color][/u] - Technically no; all textures and necessary files are included to get the armors into your game right away. [i]BUT[/i], you might want to download the originals anyway. The Amazing World of Bikini Armor (and related/similar mods) does include additional content that the replacer doesn't contain, including such elements as followers and some really neat headgear options (which require an esp to use and so would not fit well into a replacer).\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u][color=#b4a7d6][size=3][b]Package Details[/b][/size][/color][/u]\n<br />There are multiple packages available for download\n<br />\n<br />[u]TAWOBA Replacer Basic[/u] - It contains all necessary textures, Bodyslide group files, and all armor pieces (including boots and gauntlets) for the CBBE base body and CBBE physics body. The armors are organized as the \"Bikini Replacer\" and \"Bikini Replacer (Physics)\" groups in Bodyslide.\n<br />\n<br />[u]TAWOBA Replacer HDT-SMP[/u] - Similar to the Basic package, and provides armors that employ the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29023]CBBE SMP (3BBB)[/url] physics body, including body collision shapes (though without any super-fancy additional collision shapes for cloth pieces, I'm sorry to say). These armor sets will be in the \"Bikini Replacer (SMP)\" group and are identified by the (SMP) suffix in Bodyslide. Contains all necessary textures and BodySlide files.\n<br />\n<br />[u]TAWOBA Replacer 3BBB Amazing Body[/u] - Contains all textures and BodySlide files compatible with the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30174]CBBE 3BBB Amazing Body[/url]. Armor pieces will be in the \"Bikini Replacer (3BA)\" group and are identified by the (3BA) suffix in Bodyslide.\n<br />\n<br />Also included  in all packages are 1st person armor builds. These are essentially bare arms, offered to minimize clipping in first person mode. First person gauntlet sets are also included for armor sets that require them. Note that these sets are not necessarily optimized for first person use, and so may still show some minor clipping. It is likely, however, to be less clipping than [i]not[/i] using them. So feel free to utilize them at your own discretion, or don't.\n<br />\n<br />[color=#9fc5e8][size=3][u][b]Additional Notes and Features[/b][/u][/size][/color]\n<br />-All armors are uniquely modified to allow the customization option of gauntlets on one hand/arm only (which I thought was a necessary and very cool looking feature). Achieving this required deleting the forearm partition in the Bodyslide mesh (but not the armor record, as that would require an esp). The result will not, as far as I'm aware, have any impact on gameplay. In [i]theory[/i], removal of this partition could result in minor clipping when using vanilla gloves or gauntlets. In [i]practice[/i], however, I was unable to find any definite clipping when using vanilla gloves or gauntlets.\n<br />\n<br />Do note that attempting to use \"1 handed gauntlets\" built with these Bodyslide files alongside any armor [i]not[/i] from the Bikini Replacer will likely result in an invisible wrist. So if that happens, you'll know the reason, and if you post on the forums about it, everyone will know you didn't read my thorough instructions and you'll be totally embarrassed.\n<br />\n<br />-Many armors have one or more breastplate options that employ hidden zaps to disable physics (to prevent the unimmerssive bouncing of solid metal plates). Due to the way this is implemented, it could result in unusual visual effects, such as broken bodypaints around the breastplate area (since the actual body there has been zapped away). If you run into this problem but still want to use the breastplates, I've also provided a (Bouncy) version of each that will simply act as a standard physics-enabled armor piece.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b][u][color=#ea9999][size=3]Potentially Asked Questions[/size][/color][/u][/b]\n<br />Q: Will there ever be a BHUNP version?\n<br />A: I can safely say there won't be any such thing forthcoming (from me, anyway) at any point in the foreseeable future.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Will you make a non-replacer version?\n<br />A: Are you really potentially asking me this? Frankly, you should be embarrassed that I even anticipated such a thing. But no, I'm afraid not. If you want a non-replacer version, you can get The Amazing World of Bikini Armor, [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2309]Legendary Armors[/url], or somesuch other option.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Will you be porting it to LE?\n<br />A: Not necessary. Oldrim already has numerous other options for bikini replacers such as [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/81114]this one[/url] and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/72775]this one[/url]﻿, in addition to LE versions of TAWOBA, Legendary Armors, and [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/85739]Bikini Maiden[/url]﻿.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Can I add images of my characters in the armor?\n<br />A: Yes, don't even hesitate. The more the merrier.\n<br />\n<br />Q: How do I uninstall?\n<br />A: First, uninstall the mod as normal. Then, to remove the armors from your system, you will need to either overwrite them by building alternative BodySlide vanilla replacer armors (the BodySlide base install should include a suitable set of outfits) or by deleting the armor meshes from their subfolders in the data-&gt;meshes-&gt;armor folder. This will return the armor shapes to the vanilla defaults.\n<br />\n<br />Q: Why do I have to do all that?\n<br />A: Because that's just how BodySlide works.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[u][b][color=#b6d7a8][size=3]Mods in Screenshots\n<br />[/size][/color][/b][/u][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38877]CBBE Muscle Solution[/url]﻿\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2504]Argonian Fins\n<br />[/url][url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/184]Feminine Argonian Textures[/url]﻿ (lizard type)\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1089]Re-Engaged ENB[/url] (Full Quality, Extreme DOF, Cathedral Weathers compatible)\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6817]KS Hairdos SSE[/url]﻿\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26795]Sunstarved Tanlines[/url]﻿\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24495]Female Makeup Suite[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23636]Nordic Warmaiden Body Hair[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/86208]Freckle Mania 2[/url]﻿ (LE version, manual port)\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1062]Brows[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19355]Demoniac High-Quality Glossy Female Body Texture[/url]﻿ (Realgirl + SG Head + glossy specmap, 4K)\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35382]aMidianBorn Book of Silence SSE[/url]\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22860]Poser Hotkeys SE[/url]﻿\n<br />[url=https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35785]Expressive Facegen Morphs[/url]﻿ (the #1 easiest way to make not-ugly characters)"
