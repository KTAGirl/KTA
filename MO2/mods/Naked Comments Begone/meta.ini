nexusDescription="This is a very simple mod which makes it so that NPCs no longer make comments about you being naked when you're not wearing clothes. It provides an ESPFE which sets the global variable,Â [i]WICommentChanceNaked[/i], to 0 and makes it a constant. So, as long as no other mod messes with that variable, the chances of anyone commenting on your lack of clothing should be 0% and remain 0%."
